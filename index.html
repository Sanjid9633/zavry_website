          <p>
            A vibrant Startup collective of young innovators from diverse worlds of Engineering and Commerce, we’ve united with a shared vision: to transform the restaurant industry with a fresh and powerful twist. What began as a close-knit circle of friends has blossomed into a team of eight passionate individuals (as of November 2024), each bringing unique strengths and boundless dedication.
            We’ve crossed college campuses, transcended fields of study, and broken through conventional boundaries—all for one purpose: to breathe life into Zavry. With ambition in our hearts and a fierce commitment to excellence, we’re on a journey to build a new startup legacy. Together, we're pouring our best into this venture, driven by a belief in what Zavry can become and the impact it can have. This is just the beginning, and we’re ready to inspire, innovate, and redefine.
            we say "Zearch.Zavour.Zhare"

          <h2 class="section-title">How we see our future</h2>
          <p>
            Our vision for Zavry is deeply rooted in our pride and passion for the food culture of our country. We see Zavry growing into more than just a platform; we want it to be a trusted space where restaurants and customers come together to celebrate and elevate local dining. We aim to build Zavry into a name people recognize for quality, transparency, and connection—a platform where the first step to becoming a celebrated eatery is simply registering with us.

            We envision Zavry as a trusted partner to both small family-owned diners and well-established restaurants, helping them reach people who genuinely appreciate great food. By making Zavry the go-to place for exploring and reviewing local eateries, we’re setting our sights on becoming a unicorn startup, one that’s not only successful but also meaningful and impactful. This journey is about more than growth; it's about building a platform that respects and nurtures our local dining community
